# SHIM: Simple HTTP Interceptor (MyGodWhyAreYouNotUsingHTTPS)

This project is essentially arpspoof + sslstrip, but more customizable.
Write custom interception rules for requests. Inject JavaScript, flip the
page upside down, replace the font with Comic Sans, you name it!

But mainly, this project was just a way for me to learn Go. Unless you
want to write your own filter rules, there's no real reason to use this
over just arpspoof and sslstrip.

This project is a work in progress.
